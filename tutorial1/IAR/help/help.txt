A) Black box attacks


You can discover four different vulnerabilities just by playing with the SD application
1) a timing leak when unlocking PIN verification
2) a format string bug when SD is echoing the command
3) a lack of lower bound check on slot accesses (negative slot bug, harder to spot) 
4) a buffer overflow during command processing


B) White box attacks
With the source/binary code, you can better exploit some of the bugs above (3 and 4).
Also you can discover a fifth vulnerability :
5) a stack underflow bug while writing into slots
