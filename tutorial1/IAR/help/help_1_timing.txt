tutorial1 timing leak exploit
----------------------------

The IAR simulator conveniently shows the total number of cycles when using senda.bat script.
For example:
> senda U0
<      IAR C-SPY Command Line Utility V8.3.2.5988
<     Copyright 2000-2019 IAR Systems AB.
<
<ready...
<u0
<ok
<ERROR: Could not read from file handle 0
<
<
<    CSpyBat terminating.
<
<total 3725 cycles
>

If you try other single digit value you will discover that value 2 takes more time to process than all other values.
> senda U2
< total 3738 cycles
This means 2 is the correct value for first digit. Then you can try to discover the second digit in a similar manner. 
> send U20 S
< ...
< device locked
< ...
< total 4108 cycles
Once second digit is found, try the next one, until device is unlocked.
Instead of having to try 10000 PIN codes (for a 4 digits PIN), you can unlock SD in at most 40 tries.
